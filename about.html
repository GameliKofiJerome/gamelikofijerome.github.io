        <p class="hidden slide-in-right">
        I'm a <strong>data-driven problem solver</strong>  with over 5 years of experience transforming data into clear, actionable insights that help teams make smarter decisions and drive meaningful results. My journey started in systems and data management, where I discovered just how powerful data can be in solving real-world challenges—and I’ve been hooked ever since.
        <br><br>
        Along the way, I’ve built strong expertise in  <strong>SQL, Power BI, Excel, and Python</strong>,
        developing dashboards, automating reporting workflows, and uncovering patterns that inform strategy and improve performance. Whether it’s boosting revenue, streamlining processes, or helping stakeholders see the story behind the numbers, I thrive at the intersection of data and decision-making.
        <br><br>
        What really drives me is curiosity - asking the right questions, diving into the data, and translating the findings into something that’s not only useful, but impactful. I enjoy working with people, making complex things simple, and bringing clarity to the chaos through data.
