                <h3>Supplier Quality & Performance Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                  Innova Manufacturing Ltd, a manufacturing company, faced significant challenges in managing supplier quality and performance due to a lack of a centralized procurement system. 
                  Without a structured approach to assessing supplier reliability, the company struggled with inconsistent vendor performance, defective materials, and production downtime. 
                  Recognizing the need for a data-driven solution, the production management team consolidated supplier and defect-related data across multiple plants. 
                  The objective of this project was to analyze supplier quality, identify the key contributors to material defects and downtime, 
                  and provide actionable insights to optimize supply chain decisions and improve overall manufacturing efficiency.

                <h3>Hospitality Domain Revenue Insights</h3>
                <p>In todayâ€™s competitive hospitality industry, data-driven decision-making is essential for maintaining market leadership and maximizing revenue.
