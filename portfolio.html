                <h3>Supplier Quality & Performance Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                  Innova Manufacturing Ltd, a manufacturing company, faced significant challenges in managing supplier quality and performance due to a lack of a centralized procurement system. 
                  Without a structured approach to assessing supplier reliability, the company struggled with inconsistent vendor performance, defective materials, and production downtime. 
                  Recognizing the need for a data-driven solution, the production management team consolidated supplier and defect-related data across multiple plants. 
                  The objective of this project was to analyze supplier quality, identify the key contributors to material defects and downtime, 
                  and provide actionable insights to optimize supply chain decisions and improve overall manufacturing efficiency.

                <h3>From Data to Strategy: Customer Segmentation in Online Retail</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Customer segmentation</strong> is a crucial strategy in the e-commerce and retail industry, enabling businesses to identify and group customers based on purchasing behavior, engagement and other key metrics. 
                      This project utilized Python data libraries—<strong>Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly</strong>—along with the <strong>K-Means Clustering algorithm</strong> to analyze over <strong>500,000</strong> customer transaction data. 
                      By segmenting customers based on <strong>RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)</strong> metrics into identify distinct groups, the aim is to enable the client, 
                      owners of an online retail store implement effective <strong>data-driven customer centric marketing strategies to optimize customer engagement and retention, and improve revenue generation</strong>.
